# Project 2 (Breakthrough game agents)

In this project we had to create a computer agent that will play the 2 player board game called [Breakthrough](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)>).

### Running the program

All assests and necessary codes are within the project folder. We can just run the command below and choose the selected gameplay option.

```bash
python game.py
```

**For settings**

Go to settings page by clicking the **setting icon** in the main menu page then change either the _board size_ or _rule_.

### Icons

These are some of the icons and assets used in the game that have some meanings.
