## Advance Artificial Intelligence class projects

This repo contains all the project source codes, documentation and resources that is done in the **`advance artificial intelligence`** class at SEMO.

### Project List

1. [Project - 1 (Search algorithm)](https://github.com/alsongarbuja/adv-ai-projects/blob/main/project-1/README.md)

> This project is a simple algorithm based project where I am using different search algorithms like `BFS`, `DFS` and `A* Search` to find the shortest path solution for a 2D maze.

> [!TIP]
> All required instruction and maze files are inside the **resources** folder.

2. [Project -2 (Breakthrough Game)](https://github.com/alsongarbuja/adv-ai-projects/blob/main/project-2/README.md)

> This project contains code that plays a 2 player game named `Breakthrough`. I am using the `minimax` & `alpha-beta` algorithm that will play the game.

3. [Project - 3 (GD, SGD, NN)](https://github.com/alsongarbuja/adv-ai-projects/blob/main/project-3/README.md)

> This project contains code for `Gradient Descent (GD)` optimizer, `Stochastic Gradient (SGD)` optimizer and a self-developed Neural Network for classificaiton of handwritten devanagrik letters
